# InspirobotToText

The python script lets http://inspirobot.me/ create an image, forwards it to http://ocr.space/ to get a .json with the text via OCR, unwraps the .json and then prints the text. That's all.

You'll need an api-key for http://ocr.space/OCRAPI if you would like to get more than 10 inspirational texts a day. And, well, sometimes the OCR fails.
